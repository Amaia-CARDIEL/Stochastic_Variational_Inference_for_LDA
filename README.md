# Stochastic_Variational_Inference_for_LDA

This repository displays an implementation of Stochastic Variational Inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), as presented in the paper: [Matthew D. Hoffman, David M. Blei, Chong Wang, John Paisley, Stochastic Variational Inference, Journal of Machine Learning Research 14 (2013) 1303-1347](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/hoffman13a/hoffman13a.pdf).

The algorithm was used to infer topics on two NLP databases: 20 newsgroup and a dataset made of BBC news articles.
